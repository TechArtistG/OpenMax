Getting this Mo Fo off the ground!  I've had a lot of code kicking around and its about time I did something useful with it.  I'll be gradually reworking all the code I have, adding comments and getting the core systems updated.  Also I'll be stting up the repo structure to handle multiple versions of Max.

Dev Plan:
* Get repo formatted
* Get support for multiple Max versions
* Add .Net (Core will be C#) projects
* Add SDK C++ projects
